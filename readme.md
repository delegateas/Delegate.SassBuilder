Delegate Sass/Scss Builder

A simple nuget package to add MSBuild targets for .sass and .scss files in your Visual Studio projects. 

There is no manual intervention required; all .sass/.scss files included in the project will simply be converted to equivalent .css files during build.

No external dependencies and no dll references will be added to your project.

Tested with Visual Studio 2013.


Works well with package restore on a build server too, though you need to do the package restore as described here https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore/team-build.


Enjoy!
